		Hey! I’m Fahad Azam. I spend most of my time working with Oracle databases, cloud technologies, and PeopleSoft systems, but I also love diving into anything tech-related that catches my curiosity. I’m a bit of a deep-dive person—I like to understand how things really work, step by step, rather than just following instructions blindly
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is where I share what I learn, experiment with, and think about. Sometimes it’s technical stuff like database tips, cloud setups, or scripts that actually make life easier. Other times, it’s more random—like thoughts on anime, personal experiences, or things that just spark my curiosity.
	</p>

	<p>
		I want this to be a place where learning feels approachable. No jargon for the sake of it, no pretending to know everything—just real insights, experiences, and discoveries that might help someone else or even just make them think.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I’m not buried in databases or tutorials, you’ll probably find me exploring anime worlds, thinking about strategies in games, or reflecting on life and progress. I believe in learning constantly, sharing openly, and keeping things honest and interesting.
	</p>

	<p>
		Welcome to my space—feel free to explore, learn, or just hang out.
